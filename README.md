# HTMLform

I created this sing up form as a part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/forms-javascript?ref=lnav) curriculum.
My objective was to learn about clien-side form validation as well as enhance my CSS skills. The form in itself doesn't submit anywhere.
